I did this code to show how accurately create model using dropout layer.
By using dropout layer model accuracy score gets lower. But its accurate.
Sometimes we create model but with high epochs we get unexpectedly high result. But when we evaluate it with test files, it gives so low result.
So, here we can use dropout layer. It help to identify false result.
